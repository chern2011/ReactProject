While it is an architectural marvel alright, did you know that this structure is also considered the longest cemetery on Earth? Over a million people died building it and archaeologists have found human remains buried under parts of the wall. Creepy much?"

Since the statue is atop a mountain, it's prone to getting hit by lightning—in fact it gets hit around three to six times a year. Prior to the FIFA World Cup in 2014, a lightning struck and broke one of the statue's thumbs. Also, this structure wasn't originally built in Brazil; it was made in France."

But this place wasn't given its due for a long time—did you know that Bedouin of the Arabian Desert destroyed some of the most priceless carvings on the Treasury's walls? They used the carvings as target during their shooting practice."

Declared as a UNESCO Heritage Site in 1983, the structure is built completely out of dry-stone walls. Many of the stones that were used to build the city were more than 50 pounds in weight, but it is said that no wheels were used to transport these rocks up the mountain. In fact it is alleged that hundreds of men pushed the heavy rocks up the steep mountain side."

Many travellers aver that the sites in Chichen Itza are known for their unusual sounds. If you clap once from one end of the Ball Court, it reverberates and creates nine echoes in the middle of the court. A clap in front of the Kukulkan Pyramid creates an echo resembling the serpent's chirp."
